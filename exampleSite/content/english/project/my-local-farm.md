## Logo, Website Development & Customer ordering and Database 

A start up company delivering fresh local fruit and vegetable produce door to door. The box scheme started as a company relying on telephone ordering and with our support developed a completely integrated online selection and ordering system. <br>Customers selected choice of goods<br>customer preferences printed for packing staff<br>orders were collated into different runs for drivers<br>

### Customer portal

Customers could login and select the products that were to be delivered that week. This customisation created customer loyalty, and many of the customers received deliveries weekly for years.

### Customer accounts and payments

Integrated into the system was online payments so that either, the customer could pay weekly, monthly, or on demand. This helped with deliveries as the customer did not have to be at home to receive the produce.
