## CostaComputerGuy Website Design

We took the ideas and design ideas from the client and produced a full
website design and maintenance solution. The client wanted to be able to easily 
make changes to the text on an ongoing basis without the need to keep
asking the design agency to update the website. This not only saves money
in the long term, but gives you the full control over changes and updates to
the public facing site.

### Hosting

The site is hosted on Netlify and this produces very fast, responsive pages
so that the end user has a great user experience.

### Language

Both English and Spanish versions of the site were produced so that users can
easily read content in both languages. Costa Computer Guy can easily add any
other language that he feels neccessary.

### Contact forms

Costa Computer Guy can receive requests via the site, enabling him to keep in 
touch with prospective clients.
