## Moriarty Management Website Design

Tom required a website to showcase the Actors that were currently under
his management. Not only did he want to advertise the talent he was working with
but also to advertise his services to other actors that may be looking for those
services.

### Workflows

We created customised workflows that made the process of adding other actors to 
the site simple and straight forward. This allowed the staff at Moriarty Management
to keep the site current and always up to date.

### Responsive design

The site had to be responsive on any device so it was created with the philosophy of
mobile first. This always ensures that the site displays well on all screen sizes.
