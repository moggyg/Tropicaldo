## Mountain and sea views Blog Site

An easy to use Blog site was created so that the ramblings of an exotic traveller could be posted
for all to see, read, and comment.

### Workflows
The site had to be easy to use and post, with build in workflow to publish the articles not only on
the blog site but to Facebook, twitter, and other social media platforms.
